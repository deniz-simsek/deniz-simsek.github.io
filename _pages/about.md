I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Management at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. I am advised by Professors [Achal Bassamboo](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/bassamboo_achal/) and [Ohad Perry](https://people.smu.edu/operry/homepage/). My dissertation committee also includes Professors [Itai Gurvich](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/gurvich_itai.aspx) and [Rob Bray](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/bray_robert/).

My research lies at the intersection of service operations, queueing theory, and applied probability, with a particular focus on the modeling and control of large-scale service systems.

I hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://w3.ie.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) (Ankara, Turkey), earned in 2019 and 2021, respectively.

**I am on the 2025â€“2026 academic job market.**
